**WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop** - 
	1. result app stopped after db pod stop because , it lost connection with Db , so it unable to fetch the query of result. 
	2. So to start again we have to restart the result app.

	And restart is happening because int the code , a error habdling is wtitten , for restart the pod.
